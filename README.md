This application also keeps track of their current prescriptions to remind them when to take their medication.

The front-end of this app is built using React, hosted on Vercel, and this is found in the `front-end` branch of this repo. This connects to an API that we created that makes use of OpenAI's Da Vinci Model to retrieve information from the Internet. The back-end is built using Flask, hosted on Microsoft Azure, and is found in the `back-end` branch.
